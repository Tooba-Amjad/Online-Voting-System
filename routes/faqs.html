        <h1> Frequently Ask Questions</h1>
        <b>  Q1 :Will I be saving time & money?<b><br><br><br>
        Utilizing a free online voting software will provide some immediate cost-savings,
         especially on paper ballots and postage or poll workers for in-person contests.
          However, there are many trade-offs you must consider. Although you’ll be saving a chunk of your budget, you’ll be
           losing time and may not have the opportunity to take advantage of additional features and services, that will improve 
           elections going forward. For example, you won’t have the promise of security and secrecy, and there’s always the chance
            the service will share your data with third-party companies. Additionally, your organization won’t be able to utilize 
            multiple methods of voting, which can increase voter turnout and 
        engagement because it gives members more of a choice as to how to participate.<br><br><br>
       <b>Q2: Is the process going to be seamless and easy to use?</b><br><br><br>
       YesElections offers a simple and easy-to-use online voting software that seamlessly
        integrates with your organization’s website. Our company sets up the system and provides 
        step-by-step directions on how to cast a ballot from any device, so you don’t have to.
         This ensures all members know when, where, and how they can make their voice heard.  <br><br><br>
